This was my project during my university studies in 2023. 
In this project, I used Knowledge distilation approach to generate face swap and SimSwap as primary teaching architecture including other multiple loss functions.
I will upload model weights in google drive.
Most of the source code is taken from SimSwap, however there are few changes are made for use of knowledge distilation method.
I have uploaded demo image from my research paper published to university, meantime I will update this repo.
